# VTEX Product Breadcrumb

This block (`breadcrumb.product`) is meant to be used inside your product page. It uses the Product Context and only fetches data from there.

It has the same props as the original `breadcrumb` block.

## Example usage

```
js
"store.product": {
  "children": ["breadcrumb.product"]
}
```

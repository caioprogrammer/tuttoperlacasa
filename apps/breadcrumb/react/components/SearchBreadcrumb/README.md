# VTEX Search Breadcrumb

This block (`breadcrumb.search`) is meant to be used inside your search page. It uses the Search Page Context and only fetches data from there.

It has the same props as the original `breadcrumb` block.

## Example usage

```
js
"search-result-layout.desktop": {
  "children": ["breadcrumb.search"]
}
```
